- 👋 Hi! I’m Rico, an IT consultant and full stack web developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in information systems with applications in enterprise development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about OWASP internet security to understand how they limit commercial platforms' scalability.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on e-commerce-related projects that expland my learning and builds my experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll add contact details soon! In the meantime, I think you can contact me here on github (I'm not sure if this is possible because I still don't understand much of github's features)
